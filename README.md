## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Back-End Developer passionate about building robust, scalable, and high-performance systems, with strong experience in cloud-native architectures and real-time communication platforms.
Currently, I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at <strong>UFBA (Universidade Federal da Bahia)</strong>, where I strengthen my foundations in software engineering, system design, and computational theory.
I enjoy working close to infrastructure and architecture decisions, always focusing on clean code, scalability, and maintainability.

Key areas of interest:
- Designing and developing RESTful APIs and microservices
- Serverless and cloud-native development using AWS
- Real-time communication systems with Twilio (Flex, Functions, Sync)
- Relational and NoSQL databases, including PostgreSQL and DynamoDB
- Front-end integration using React and JavaScript
